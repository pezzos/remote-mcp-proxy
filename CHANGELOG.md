## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Subdomain-based URL Format**: Complete implementation of subdomain-based routing (`https://{server}.mcp.{domain}/sse`) for Remote MCP standard compliance
  - **Subdomain Middleware**: Automatic server extraction from subdomains with validation
  - **Environment Configuration**: Dynamic domain configuration via environment variables (MCP_DOMAIN, DOMAIN, PORT)
  - **Traefik Wildcard Support**: Automatic wildcard subdomain routing configuration
  - **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests for subdomain validation, routing, and environment configuration
- **Comprehensive Changelog Management**: Automated changelog workflow integrated into CLAUDE.md development guidelines
- **Traefik Session Persistence**: Sticky sessions, health checks, and SSE-optimized headers for better connection reliability
- **Development Protocol**: Structured commit message conventions and documentation management process
- **Method Fallback System**: Intelligent fallback responses for unsupported MCP methods like `resources/list`, `prompts/list` to improve Claude.ai compatibility
- **Request Timeout Handling**: Automatic timeout detection for unresponsive MCP methods with 3-second fallback responses
- **Bearer Token Authentication**: Required OAuth Bearer token authentication for Claude.ai Remote MCP compatibility
- **OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration**: Complete OAuth 2.0 DCR implementation with discovery endpoint, client registration, authorization flow, and token exchange following RFC 7591
- **Tool Name Normalization**: Automatic conversion of tool names from hyphenated format (API-get-user) to snake_case (api_get_user) for Claude.ai compatibility

### Fixed
- ðŸ”¥ **CRITICAL: Claude.ai Connection Issue Resolved**: Fixed the "Connect" button failing in Claude.ai Remote MCP integration
  - **Root Cause**: Stdio deadlock during MCP server initialize handshake causing "context deadline exceeded" errors
  - **Solution 1**: Added dedicated `readMu` mutex in `mcp/manager.go` to serialize stdout reads and prevent race conditions
  - **Solution 2**: Fixed session initialization bug where sessions were never marked as initialized after successful handshake
  - **Solution 3**: Increased initialize timeout from 10 to 30 seconds for slow npm-based MCP servers
  - **Impact**: Claude.ai Remote MCP integration now works reliably - Connect button succeeds and tools are properly exposed
- **Critical Session Management Bug**: Fixed session ID handling to properly use Claude.ai's `Mcp-Session-Id` header instead of generating new sessions for each request
- **SSE Connection Coordination**: Ensured SSE connections use the same session management as POST requests for proper state persistence
- **MCP Method Compatibility**: Resolved "Method not found" errors by providing empty responses for optional MCP methods that servers don't implement
- **Unresponsive Request Handling**: Fixed issue where `resources/list` requests would hang indefinitely when MCP servers don't respond, now provides automatic fallback after 3-second timeout
- **Authentication Deployment Issue**: Identified and documented that authentication code is implemented but not deployed to Docker server
- **Tool Naming Convention Issue**: Fixed Claude.ai tool discovery by normalizing tool names from hyphenated format (API-get-user) to snake_case (api_get_user) with bidirectional transformation for tool calls

### Changed
- **URL Format**: Migrated from path-based (`/memory/sse`) to subdomain-based (`https://memory.mcp.domain.com/sse`) routing for Remote MCP standard compliance
- **Router Configuration**: Updated HTTP router to use root-level endpoints (`/sse`, `/sessions/{sessionId}`) with subdomain middleware for server detection
- **Documentation**: Updated README.md with DNS wildcard configuration instructions and Traefik wildcard routing setup
- **Docker Compose Configuration**: Enhanced with Traefik optimizations including CORS headers, connection persistence, and resource management
- **CLAUDE.md Guidelines**: Added mandatory changelog management protocol and automated commit preparation workflow
- **Request Tracking**: Enhanced protocol translator to track pending requests for intelligent error handling
- **Authentication Requirement**: Implemented Bearer token validation that rejects requests without proper Authorization header
- **OAuth Endpoints**: Added comprehensive OAuth 2.0 endpoints (/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server, /oauth/register, /oauth/authorize, /oauth/token) with proper CORS support

### Security
- **Authentication Flow**: Claude.ai integration now requires Bearer token authentication matching Remote MCP specification requirements
- **OAuth 2.0 Compliance**: Full OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration implementation ensures secure authentication handshake with Claude.ai
