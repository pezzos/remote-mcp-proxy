## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Comprehensive Changelog Management**: Automated changelog workflow integrated into CLAUDE.md development guidelines
- **Traefik Session Persistence**: Sticky sessions, health checks, and SSE-optimized headers for better connection reliability
- **Development Protocol**: Structured commit message conventions and documentation management process

### Fixed
- **Critical Session Management Bug**: Fixed session ID handling to properly use Claude.ai's `Mcp-Session-Id` header instead of generating new sessions for each request
- **SSE Connection Coordination**: Ensured SSE connections use the same session management as POST requests for proper state persistence

### Changed
- **Docker Compose Configuration**: Enhanced with Traefik optimizations including CORS headers, connection persistence, and resource management
