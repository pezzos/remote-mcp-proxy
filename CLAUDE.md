# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Remote MCP Proxy service that runs in Docker to bridge local MCP servers with Claude's Remote MCP protocol. The proxy serves multiple MCP servers through different URL paths (e.g., `mydomain.com/notion-mcp/sse`, `mydomain.com/memory-mcp/sse`).

## Documentation

Complete documentation is organized in the `docs/` directory:

- **[docs/development.md](docs/development.md)** - Development guide, commands, protocols, and implementation standards
- **[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)** - Technical architecture and implementation phases  
- **[docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md)** - Problem analysis and debugging guides

## Quick Reference

### Development Commands
- **Local Build**: `go build -o remote-mcp-proxy .`
- **Test**: `go test ./...` or `./test/run-tests.sh`
- **Lint**: `go fmt ./...` and `go vet ./...`
- **Docker Build**: `docker build -t remote-mcp-proxy .`

### Key Development Rules
1. **Always use TodoWrite** for planning complex tasks
2. **Run linting commands** after code changes: `go fmt ./...` and `go vet ./...`
3. **Verify builds** with `go build -o remote-mcp-proxy .`
4. **Update documentation** in `docs/` when making architectural changes
5. **Follow error handling patterns** - log both success and failure with appropriate levels

### Configuration
Service expects `/app/config.json` with same format as `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "command-to-run", 
      "args": ["arg1", "arg2"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```
