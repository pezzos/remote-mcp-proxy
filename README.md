# Remote MCP Proxy

**Seamlessly use your favorite MCP servers anywhere**. This project packages a small Go proxy that lets you connect local or experimental MCP servers to Claude.ai and the mobile app. Even if a server isn't officially "remote" yet, this proxy exposes it over Claude's new Remote MCP protocol so you can start integrating immediately.

## Why This Exists

Existing MCP servers often run only on your desktop, making them impossible to use with Claude's web UI or phone app. The Remote MCP protocol solves this, but not every server supports it yet. This proxy fills that gap so you can experiment right away.

## How It Works

Run the proxy in Docker and it will:
- Launches and monitors your local MCP servers automatically
- Converts traffic between HTTP/SSE and standard MCP JSON-RPC
- Hosts several MCP servers at once under different URL paths
- Reuses the familiar `claude_desktop_config.json` format
- Shuts down cleanly and cleans up any spawned processes
- Exposes a `/health` endpoint so you can check status at a glance

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Configuration File

Create a `config.json` file describing your MCP servers (same format as `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notion-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anthropic-ai/mcp-server-notion"],
      "env": {
        "NOTION_TOKEN": "your_notion_token_here"
      }
    },
    "memory-mcp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "memory_mcp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Run with Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t remote-mcp-proxy .

# Run the proxy
docker run -d \
  --name mcp-proxy \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v $(pwd)/config.json:/app/config.json:ro \
  remote-mcp-proxy
```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with your domain configuration:

```bash
# Copy example file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your domain
echo "DOMAIN=your-domain.com" > .env
```

### 4. Use Docker Compose with Traefik

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will deploy the service with Traefik reverse proxy integration, making it accessible at `mcp.{DOMAIN}` with automatic HTTPS.

### 5. Configure Claude.ai

Open Claude.ai (or the mobile app) and add your proxy URLs. Example:
 - `https://mcp.your-domain.com/notion-mcp/sse`
 - `https://mcp.your-domain.com/memory-mcp/sse`

Use the domain you set in `.env`.

## URL Structure

Each MCP server is available at:
```
https://mcp.{DOMAIN}/{server-name}/sse
```

Where `{DOMAIN}` is set in your `.env` file and `{server-name}` matches the key in your `config.json` file.

## Configuration

The proxy uses the same configuration format as Claude Desktop's `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "command-to-run",
      "args": ["arg1", "arg2"],
      "env": {
        "ENV_VAR": "value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

#### Docker Compose Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used by the Docker Compose setup:

- **`DOMAIN`**: Your base domain name (e.g., `example.com`). The service will be accessible at `mcp.{DOMAIN}`

#### MCP Server Environment Variables

- Set environment variables for your MCP servers in the `env` section of `config.json`
- Store secrets securely and reference them in your Docker deployment
- The proxy will pass these environment variables to the spawned MCP processes

## Docker Compose with Traefik

The service is configured to work with Traefik reverse proxy for automatic HTTPS and domain routing:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  remote-mcp-proxy:
    build: .
    container_name: remote-mcp-proxy
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./config.json:/app/config.json:ro
    environment:
      - GO_ENV=production
    networks:
      - proxy
    labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      - traefik.http.routers.remote-mcp-proxy.rule=Host(`mcp.${DOMAIN}`)
      - traefik.http.routers.remote-mcp-proxy.entrypoints=websecure
      - traefik.http.routers.remote-mcp-proxy.tls.certresolver=myresolver
networks:
  proxy:
    external: true
```

Make sure to:
1. Create a `.env` file with your `DOMAIN` variable
2. Have Traefik running with the `proxy` network
3. Configure SSL certificate resolver in Traefik

## Development

./test/run-tests.sh
```

#### Manual Testing

```bash
# Unit tests only
go test -v ./protocol ./mcp ./proxy

# Integration tests
go test -v .

  -H "Accept: text/event-stream"
```

#### Test Coverage

The test suite covers:

- **Protocol Translation**: JSON-RPC â†” Remote MCP message conversion
- **Connection Management**: Session handling, timeouts, cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Invalid requests, server failures, network issues
- **Concurrency**: Multiple simultaneous connections
- **Authentication**: Token validation and CORS
- **Health Checks**: Server status monitoring
- **Integration**: End-to-end workflow testing

#### CI/CD Testing

For automated testing in CI environments:

```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Run tests with XML output (for CI)
go test -v ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html

# Static analysis
go vet ./...
go fmt ./...
```

### Adding New MCP Servers

1. Add the server configuration to `config.json`
2. Restart the proxy container
3. The new server will be available at `/{server-name}/sse`

## Architecture

The proxy is built in Go and consists of:

- **HTTP Proxy Server**: Handles incoming Remote MCP requests using Gorilla Mux router
- **MCP Process Manager**: Spawns and manages local MCP server processes with health monitoring
- **Protocol Translator**: Converts between HTTP/SSE and MCP JSON-RPC protocols
- **Configuration Loader**: Reads and validates MCP server configs (claude_desktop_config.json format)
- **SSE Handler**: Implements Server-Sent Events for real-time Remote MCP communication

### Technology Stack

- **Go 1.21**: Core language for performance and concurrency
- **Gorilla Mux**: HTTP routing and path-based server selection
- **Standard Library**: Process management (`os/exec`), HTTP/SSE, JSON handling
- **Alpine Linux**: Minimal Docker base image for production deployment

## Monitoring and Health Checks

The proxy includes several endpoints for monitoring and debugging:

### Health Check
```bash
# Check proxy health
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# Response: {"status":"healthy"}
```

### List Configured MCP Servers
```bash
# List all configured MCP servers and their status
curl http://localhost:8080/listmcp
# Response: {"count":1,"servers":[{"name":"notionApi","running":true,"pid":11,"command":"npx","args":["-y","@notionhq/notion-mcp-server"]}]}
```

### List Tools for an MCP Server
```bash
# List available tools for a specific MCP server
curl http://localhost:8080/listtools/{server-name}
# Example: curl http://localhost:8080/listtools/notionApi
# Response: {"server":"notionApi","response":{"id":"...","jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"tools":[...]}}}
```

These endpoints are useful for:
- **Health monitoring**: Verify the proxy is running
- **Configuration debugging**: Check which MCP servers are configured and running
- **Tool discovery**: See what tools are available from each MCP server
- **Troubleshooting**: Identify if MCP servers are properly started and responding

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Won't Start
- Check the command and arguments in your config
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Look at proxy logs for process spawn errors
- Ensure required dependencies are available in the container

### Connection Issues
- Ensure the proxy is accessible from Claude.ai
- Check firewall and network configuration
- Verify SSL/TLS setup for HTTPS endpoints
- Test the SSE endpoint directly: `curl http://localhost:8080/{server-name}/sse`
- Use the monitoring endpoints to debug:
  - Check if MCP servers are running: `curl http://localhost:8080/listmcp`
  - Verify tools are available: `curl http://localhost:8080/listtools/{server-name}`

### Protocol Errors
- Confirm your MCP server supports the expected protocol version
- Check for proper JSON-RPC message formatting
- Review SSE connection handling
- Monitor proxy logs for translation errors
